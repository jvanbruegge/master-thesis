\begin{itemize}
\item{Formal proofs about programming languages need to be able to deal with bound/free variables}
\item{Also needs capture avoiding substitution}
\item{Barendregt's variable convention makes proofs a lot easier, but in a formal setting, this convention has to be proven correct}
\item{Generalization of normal datatypes can deal with those issues and provide special induction principles with the variable convention builtin}
\item{Example of a simple lambda calculus}
\item{Show multi (recursive) let, with distinct variables (POPL Example 4)}
\end{itemize}
